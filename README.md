# redshift_data_project
Machine learning project for Alex Malz

Goals for this project: 
- Generally, I want to be at the point with coding where I can be efficient and actually know what I'm doing. This involves knowing not only Python well, but scipy, numpy, etc.
- I want to predict something with machine learning (versus just fitting a line to data).
- I want to be able to apply this knowledge to other datasets or types of data so when I do this in the future, I won't be so lost.
